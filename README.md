## Course Outline

The world is experiencing an explosion in the amount of data being produced and collected - estimated to have crossed over 2 Zettabytes (10^21) in 2012. Online data is produced continuously by different types of sensors, processes, and human activities. Being able to analyze this large amount of data as it is generated continuously, and distil insights for improved decision making, is vital to the functioning of several large and complex applications in various domains. These domains include financial systems, cyber- and physical-security systems, environmental monitoring, health care,  manufacturing systems, telecommunication networks and power distribution grids.

Current database and data warehouse based store-and-process information management technologies are ill-suited to meet the performance, scalability, and usability requirements of these applications. This has led to the emergence of new paradigms for distributed compute systems and analytic algorithms - including Map-Reduce for offline data, and Stream processing for online data. 

Stream processing is a novel distributed compute paradigm that supports the gathering, processing, and analysis of high-volume, heterogeneous, continuous data streams, to extract insights and actionable results in real time. In this course, we will cover fundamentals of the stream processing paradigm in teo parts. First, we will introduce key components such as the distributed system infrastructure, a novel programming model, and application design and implementation. Next, we will discuss emerging mining algorithms for pre-processing, classification, clustering, anomaly detection, and pattern mining.

Throughout the course, we will describe the underlying theoretical principles, and provide illustrative examples from real-world case studies. Finally, this course will include hands-on exposure to large-scale stream processing through relevant homework assignments involving programming exercises on a real stream processing system. Students will design and implement a final project to explore the state-of-the art in this field.
